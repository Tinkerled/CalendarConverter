Convert a schedule from .csv to .ics

I wrote this program to enter my school schedule into my Google Calendar.

The school gave us a calendar that is a set of images that is very inconvinient to access and read. There is no easy way to enter it into Google Calendar. The best way to do so automatically is to import a .ics calendar file. But the easiest way to write the calendar is by entering the event into a spreadsheet.

I wrote a simple Google Sheet with the event info and exported it to a .csv file. Then I made a simple C++ program to write a .ics file based on the .csv file. 

Original Google Sheet available here:

PS THIS IS NOT THE EASIEST WAY TO DO THIS. Just import a .csv into Google Calendar...
